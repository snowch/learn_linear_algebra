    "In this workshop, we will learn the basics of Linear Algebra by being hands-on - only basic math knowledge required!!\n",
    "\n",
    "I created this workshop as revision notes while I was learning Linear Algebra, but it may be useful for students who prefer to get hands-on with concepts before jumping deep into theory.\n",
    "\n",

    "**View:** to view the notebooks, you can [start here](https://nbviewer.org/github/snowch/learn_linear_algebra/tree/master/notebooks/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interact:** If you would like an interactive environment to experiment with the notebook code, you can run then online for free [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/snowch/learn_linear_algebra/master?labpath=00-start-here.ipynb)\n",

    "Notes for the interactive environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it may take about 5 mins to launch the environment\n",
    "- notebook state is not persisted - anything you add is lost when the notebook session closes\n",
    "- the notebooks have an inactivity timeout of 10 mins after which the session closes\n"
